# Project Health Report - Discover XYZ
**Date**: 2025-07-31  
**Compiled by**: Pam (Technical Project Manager)

## Executive Summary

### Overall Health Score: 4.5/10 ⚠️

The Discover XYZ project shows potential but faces critical security vulnerabilities and significant quality issues that must be addressed before production deployment. While the foundation includes modern technologies (Next.js, PayloadCMS, Better Auth), the implementation has serious gaps in security, testing, accessibility, and UI consistency.

### Critical Issues Found: 8
### High Priority Issues: 12
### Medium Priority Issues: 15
### Quick Wins Available: 23
### Estimated Total Effort: 89 story points (3-4 sprints)

### Immediate Action Required
**🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY BREACH**: API keys and secrets are exposed in the repository's .env file. These must be rotated IMMEDIATELY and removed from git history.

- Payload secret keys

**Immediate Actions**:
1. Rotate ALL exposed credentials NOW
2. Remove .env from git history
3. Add .env to .gitignore
4. Deploy with new secrets

### 2. 🧪 Failing Test Suite (69.4% Pass Rate)
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Impact**: Cannot verify code quality or prevent regressions  
**Evidence**: 37 of 121 tests failing
- Import resolution errors
- Type mismatches
- Missing test coverage for auth, API, UI

### 3. ♿ Missing Critical Accessibility Features
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Impact**: Legal compliance risk, excludes users with disabilities  
**Evidence**: 
- No skip navigation links
- Form errors not announced

### 4. 🎨 Severe UI Inconsistencies
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Impact**: Poor user experience, unprofessional appearance  
**Evidence**:
- Hardcoded colors throughout (should use design tokens)
- Raw HTML buttons instead of Button component
- No user menu or logout option visible
- Missing loading states
