# Seed Script Authentication Fix - SECURE Implementation

## Issue
When clicking the "Seed your database" button from the admin dashboard, the operation was failing with:
```
Error in beforeChange hook: Error [APIError]: Access denied. Your email is not authorized for SSO access.
```

This was happening because the seed script was trying to create a demo author with email `demo-author@example.com` which doesn't match any allowed SSO patterns.

## Security Considerations
The initial approach of bypassing validation was **insecure** because:
1. Context flags can be passed by any API call
2. Hardcoded email bypasses create permanent backdoors
3. No proper access control on who can seed

## Secure Solution Implemented

### 1. Admin-Only Seed Access
Updated `/src/app/(frontend)/next/seed/route.ts` to only allow admin users:
```typescript
// SECURE: Only allow admins to seed the database
if (!authenticatedUser || authenticatedUser.role !== 'admin') {
  return new Response('Only administrators can seed the database.', { status: 403 })
}
```

### 2. Use Authenticated Admin as Content Author
Instead of creating a demo author that bypasses SSO, the seed script now uses the authenticated admin user as the author for seeded content:
```typescript
// Use the current admin user as the author for seeded content
// This is more secure than creating a bypass user
const currentUser = req.user

if (!currentUser) {
  throw new Error('No authenticated user found for seeding')
}
```

### 3. No Validation Bypasses
- Removed any validation bypass logic
- All users must match SSO patterns
- No hardcoded exceptions

## Result
The seed button now works correctly and securely:
1. Admin logs in with valid SSO email
2. Admin clicks "Seed your database" button
3. Sample content is created with the admin as author
4. Database is successfully seeded
5. No security vulnerabilities introduced

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Login to admin panel at http://localhost:3026/admin with a valid SSO email
2. Click the "Seed your database" button
3. Should see "Database seeded!" success message
4. Articles will show the admin user as the author

## Security Benefits
- No validation bypasses that could be exploited
- Only admins can seed the database
- All users must have valid SSO emails
- No backdoor accounts created
